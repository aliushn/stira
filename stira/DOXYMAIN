\mainpage STIRA (old name FRIEP) Simple Toolkit for Image Restoration and Analysis
\brief STIRA (old name FRIEP) stands for Simple Toolkit for Image Restoration and Analysis.
This toolkit aims to provide a clearly written, well-documented, independent C++ toolkit for image restoration 
and analysis. With "simple", "clear" and "well-written", we aim to make the threshold to use the code as low as possible by 
limiting number of lines per method, choosing well-readable names for variables, methods and classes and avoiding code 
duplication through inheritance and usage of templates. All functions are provided with doxygen documentation with 
some explanation of the method and all of its parameters. Independent refers to the fact that the toolkit is self-contained, 
so not depending on external libraries. The only exceptions are FFTW3 (http://www.fftw.org/) and OpenCV 2.0 (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/).

All code was written by myself unless stated otherwise. Some methods or algorithms were based on code or pseudocode published online. In
that case, the references are mentioned in the doxygen comments for those methods.
