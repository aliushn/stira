This software is designed to provide a simple, unified toolkit for image processing 
research and software development. It is called STIRA (Simple Toolkit for Image 
Restoration and Analysis) and was written by Filip Rooms, unless mentioned otherwise 
(see below). 

The goal was to provide code that is very readable; all methods and variables are 
(or at least should be) documented using doxygen. Also, for almost all code, test 
applications are added to test functionality (and quality) of the code. However, keep 
in mind that this source code is experimental research code and that the author cannot 
be held responsible for anything going wrong with anything made with this source code!!

2) external dependencies
////////////////////////

* OpenCV Open Source Computer Vision 2.0.0 (to check version: see /usr/include/opencv/cvver.h)
    - Availability: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/ or in a standard linux distro repository
    - Used by subprojects "common" for polynomial fitting and experiments/testHorizontalFilter/RecursiveLeastSquares and other subprojects that depend on that

* FFTW3 Fastest Fourier Transform in the West 
    - Availability: http://www.fftw.org or in a standard linux distro repository
    - Dependency can be removed, and code is then based on integrated KISS-FFT (see above)
    - Used by subprojects "fouriertools", "filter" and all other subprojects that depend on that
